# Sprite_Cranberry_Challenge
this was originally a joke with my friends but then i made it
it creates a window, and when you click space, the sprite cranberry add with lebron james plays.
your score increses the more you watch the add
your high score will save in a text file
click space or the x to close the program while the video is running
Warning: This is still a work in progress, some features may not work. 
Currently it freezes when you try to pplay the video but i have identifyed the problem and solution and am working on resolving it
